## 🤔 **Answers to Your Specific Questions**

### **Q: Should I move other packages to another branch?**
**A: YES, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.** For v1.0.0, I suggest:
- Keep only **VS Code + Obsidian + Terminal** themes in main branch
- Move experimental themes to `develop` branch
- Release proven platforms first, add others in v1.1.0, v1.2.0, etc.

### **Q: What's the .vsix file?**
**A:** The `.vsix` file is VS Code's extension package format. It's what you upload to the marketplace or install manually. Think of it like a `.zip` file containing your extension.

### **Q: Website in separate repo?**
**A: YES.** Create `solace-dark-website` repository because:
- Keeps main repo focused on theme code
- Different deployment pipeline (GitHub Pages/Netlify)
- Easier to manage website-specific issues
- Better SEO with dedicated domain

### **Q: How to market this?**
**A:** Follow the marketing phase above, but start with:
1. VS Code Marketplace (biggest impact)
2. Reddit communities (r/vscode, r/programming)
3. Twitter/X with screenshots
4. Dev.to article about your design process
